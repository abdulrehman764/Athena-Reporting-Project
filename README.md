# Athena Reporting Project

## Overview

The Athena Reporting Project is a Python-based solution for querying and visualizing data stored in Amazon Athena, an interactive query service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). This project enables you to run SQL-like queries on your data stored in Amazon S3 and generate informative reports with various data visualizations.

## Features

- Connects to Amazon Athena and Amazon S3 using AWS credentials.
- Executes SQL-like queries on data stored in Amazon S3 via Athena.
- Generates interactive data visualizations using Matplotlib.
- Creates a PDF report containing query results and data visualizations.
- Uploads the PDF report to an S3 bucket for easy sharing and access.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to set up your AWS credentials, configure the Athena and S3 clients, and provide your SQL queries. Then, you can run the Python script to execute your queries and generate the PDF report.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure your AWS credentials in the script.
4. Modify the SQL queries in the script to match your data analysis requirements.
5. Run the script to execute the queries and generate the PDF report.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- ReportLab (for PDF generation)
